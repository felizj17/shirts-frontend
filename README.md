Before you start the frontend check out how to get the [backend](https://github.com/felizj17/shorts-backend) up and running.

## Setup 
After cloning this project to your local machine you can run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

Then create a .env file in the root directory and insert the following;

`REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000`

NOTE: If you have your local backend running on a different port change the number to match at the end of url. 

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
